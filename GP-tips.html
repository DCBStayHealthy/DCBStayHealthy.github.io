<h1>Tips to stay healthy</h1>
        <p>Apart from a healthy diet, there are also many aspects in life that you need to pay attention to inorder to be healthy. Although having a healthy diet is an important part of staying healthy, it will not work on its own: a healthy lifestyle will definately benefit you even more. Here are some other tips to stay healthy:</p>

        <li><b>Exercise at least 30 minutes a day. </b>If you do not have enough time, you can split those exercises and do them when you are having a break from your work. Those excercises can not only burn calories, but can give your brain a rest which allows you to work more efficiently afterwards as well. Healthy excercises can include running, dancing, yoga or other activities you enjoy.</li>

        <li><b>Stay out of the sun, especially between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m.</b> Sunlight emits ultraviolet radiation, and in this time period the radiation is the strongest. Ultraviolet radiation can cause damage to surface cells, and in some extreme cases, even blindness and skin cancer. When the sun is extremely bright outside, do not forget to put sunscreen on your skin. But the easiest way is to simply stay out of it.</li>

        <li><b>Getting the appropriate amount of sleep.</b> An adult needs 6 to 8 hours of sleep. The negative effects of lack of sleep is generally well known by everyone. These impacts include raising blood pressure and heart faliure. However, research suggests that sleeping too much (over 8 hours for adults) can increase the chance of getting headaches and diseases in the respirational system. Also, Make sure you are sleeping approximately the same number of hours everyday. Do not sleep 5 hours on week days and 10 hours on weekends, bucause this might disturb your biological clock. Getting the appropriate amount of sleep every night will get you prepared for a new day.</li>
        <li><b>Limit the usage of electronic devices.</b> Sitting in front of a computer or burying your head in to a mobile phone keeps your body in the same static posture for a long time. According to a research on people who uses electronic devices on daily basis, 70% reported neck pain, 65% had shoulder pain and 46% with wrist and finger pain. Staring at the bright screen for a long time without rest can as well cause damage to your eyes. Also, using electronic devices before sleep makes you brain excited, which as a result lets the body to go to a "fight and flight" response. Cortisol, a stress hormone released by the adrenal gland will be released, and this makes you hard to sleep.</li>
        <li><b>Be aware of your emotions.</b> It might be a good idea if you list down the things you feel happy and stressed with. Likewise, you can recognise the things that make you happy. Surrounding your self with good energy will promote a healthier and happier you. For the things you feel extremely stressed with, take a deep breathe and let it go. You can also do some stress-free activities, such as reading and doing yoga to relax your brain.</li>
        <p>A healthy body is your best preperation for your success. Hope these little tips can help you to maintain a healthier lifestyle!</p>
