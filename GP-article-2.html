<h1>Top 5 Healthy Foods You Should Eat</h1>
<h2>Healthy Food N.5: Salmon</h2>
<h3>Why It's Healthy:</h3>
    <li>A great source of omega-3 fatty acids, which have been linked to a reduced risk of depression, heart disease, and cancer.</li>
    <li>A 3-ounce serving contains almost 50 percent of your daily dose of niacin, which may protect against Alzheimer's disease and memory loss.</li>

    <h2>Healthy Food N.4: Potatoes</h2>
    <h3>Why They're Healthy:</h3>
    <li>One red potato contains 66 micrograms of cell-building folate — about the same amount found in one cup of spinach or broccoli.</li>
    <li>One sweet potato has almost eight times the amount of cancer-fighting and immune-boosting vitamin A you need daily.</li>

    <h2>Healthy Food N.3: Dark Chocolate</h2>
    <h3>Why It's Healthy:</h3>
    <li>Just one-fourth of an ounce daily can reduce blood pressure in otherwise healthy individuals.</li>
    <li>Cocoa powder is rich in flavonoids, antioxidants shown to reduce "bad" LDL cholesterol and increase "good" HDL levels.</li>

    <h2>Healthy Food N.2: Broccoli</h2>
    <h3>Why It's Healthy:</h3>
    <li>One medium stalk of broccoli contains more than 100 percent of your daily vitamin K requirement and almost 200 percent of your recommended daily dose of vitamin C — two essential bone-building nutrients.</li>
    <li>The same serving also helps stave off numerous cancers.</li>

    <h2>Healthy Food N.1: Lemons</h2>
    <h3>Why It's Healthy:</h3>
    <li>Just one lemon has more than 100 percent of your daily intake of vitamin C, which may help increase "good" HDL cholesterol levels and strengthen bones.</li>
    <li>Citrus flavonoids found in lemons may help inhibit the growth of cancer cells and act as an anti-inflammatory.</li>
