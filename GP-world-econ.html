    <h1>Diet issues around the world</h1>
    <p>The health issues can be caused as a result of an unhealthy diet. Interestingly, the diseases caused are different in differenct regions, and it highly depends on the how developed the economy is. In the United States and European countries, where the economy is really developed, people often have diseases like high blood pressure and high blood sugar levels because of the excess nutrients they consumed. In those countries, the economy is stable and maintaining a high level, people in general have higher income and therefore will have more money to buy food with higher protein and nutrients. This "too-well" diet brings too much nutrients, those undigested ones build up in the body to cause diseases.</p>

    <p>In countries that are less economically developed, sometimes some people cannot get enough food and nutrition to be intaken. This deficiency can cause a variety of disease. For example, lack of protein from carbohydrates sources like rice, yams, and bananas causes kwashiorkor. This is a disease particularly found in children which causes a swollen stomach due to fluid retention, and slows down development. Another common disease children living in those regions have is rickets, which is a result of calcium and vitamin D deficiency. When next time you are dumping food into the trashcan, please remember, there are still many people in the world unsure about when their next meal is going to be.</p>
