<h1>Acid and Base Balance</h1>
    <p>The amount of dietary acid in our body is determined by the amount of acid inducing and alkaline forming foods we eat. Acid inducing foods are foods like meat. Animal protein is very acid inducing because of the high level of sulfur containing amino acids such as methionine that produces sulfuric acid when metabolized. On the contrary, fruits and vegetables are base forming, which creates bases to neutralize the acids. However, if we donâ€™t eat enough fruits and vegetables to balance out the acid inducing diets that we eat nowadays, then our kidney will have to produce ammonia to neutralizes the acid. This is because our ancestors, apes, ate base forming diets that consisted of plants and vegetables. Contemporary diets are the exact opposite, containing large amounts of meat. This sudden switch is a big cause in the current kidney disease epidemic, since the ammonia acid have a toxic have an effect on our kidneys in the long term. According to an analysis study in 2014 of 12000 americans, higher dietary acid load was associated with higher risk of protein leakage into urine, which, is an indicator of kidney damage. So in order to stop the production of ammonia acids, we should eat more fruits and vegetables to balance out the amount of acid created by meat.
