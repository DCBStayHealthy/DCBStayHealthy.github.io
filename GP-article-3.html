        <h1>Japan: The Healthiest Country in the World</h1>
        <p>People in Japan the highest life expectancy of 85.3 years. This has been attributed to its healthy diet high in certain vegetables, carbohydrates, fruits as well as fish and meat. A recommended food guide was issued by the Japanese government in 2005 which encouraged its population to eat a diet low in processed foods and saturated fats. A 15% lower mortality rate was seen for those participants who closely followed the food guide. Not surprisingly, it was mainly because of the fact that Japanese people always eat fresh food in small portions, with very little refined sugar. Some basic foods in the Japanese Weight Loss diet includes rice, fish, soy, green tea and vegetables. With diets high in soy and fish, Japanese people often have reduced risk of cardiovascular disease or stoke. Soy beans and fermented foods, on the other hand, are being shown to support a healthy digestive system. Other vegetables like seaweed may help to reduce blood pressure. Alongside their diet, the popular green tea (in particular matcha tea) is highly valued for its high antioxidant compounds which may help with fighting several cancers and viruses. As with everything, eating with the optimum portions is also the key to their healthy lifestyle. The Japanese never serve food in one large plate, instead they usually serve communally and eaten in rotation with several different dishes.</p>
