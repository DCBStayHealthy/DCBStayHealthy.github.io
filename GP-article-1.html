        <h1>A balanced diet</h1>
        <p>Our diet is the food we eat. We need food to absorb essential materials for growth and repair of tissues, to help fight disease and keep our body healthy and more importantly, to supply us with energy needed to perform daily activities. A balanced diet should include appropriate proportions of carbohydrates, protein, lipid, vitamins, minerals, water and dietary fibre. Although carbohydrates only make up 5% of the mass of the human body, they play a crucial role of supply our body cells with energy. Glucose and sugar are one sort of carbohydrate and they are mainly found in rice, bread and pasta. Starch (a polymer of glucose) is where we get most of the carbohydrates from. It is made up of long chains of glucose molecules joined together and starch is a large, insoluble molecule.  Proteins make up 18% of the mass of the human body and these polymers are made from 20 different sub-units called amino acids. All cells contain proteins therefore they are needed for growth and repair of tissues. They are found in food such as meat and fish. Lipids make up 10% of our body’s mass and they are made up of fatty acids and glycerol. Fat is deposited in certain part of the body as long-term store of energy, and the fat layer under the skin acts as insulation, reducing heat loss. Fat around organs such as kidneys also helps to protect them from mechanical damage. Too much consumption of cholesterol and saturated fat on the other hand, might cause coronary heart disease. Not only does Vitamin A help to keep our skin and hair healthy, it also makes chemicals found in the retina. As a result, a lack of this vitamin causes night blindness. Vitamin C makes connective tissues therefore vitamin C deficiency leads to a disease called scurvy. Vitamin D is needed for calcium absorption and it is normally found in eggs. The two main mineral ions are calcium and iron. They are needed to make bones and haemoglobin respectively. Just about every bodily function relies on water – we need a constant supply to replace water lost through breathing, urinating and sweating. Lastly, dietary fibre aids the movement of food through the gut. This substance is found in wholemeal bread.</p>
